    How to Run
1. Clone the repo and move into it.
2. (Optional) Place your dataset (CSV/Parquet) in a `data/` folder.
3. Launch Jupyter and open the notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter lab  # or: jupyter notebook
   ```
4. Run cells from top to bottom.

 üîé Notebook Outline
Top headings found in the notebook:
- plot.bar
- pie chart
- histogram
- dist plot
- boxplot

Planned/recorded key steps:

BI_Variate Analysis
Date: August 27, 2025
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (BI_Variate.ipynb) that explores bivariate analysis using Python libraries such as pandas, seaborn, numpy, and matplotlib. The notebook demonstrates how to calculate correlation and covariance, as well as how to visualize the relationships between two variables using various plots.

Datasets
The analysis uses three different datasets:

Titanic.csv: A classic dataset containing information about passengers on the Titanic.

Sales_Data.csv: A sales dataset with various columns such as Region, Item_Type, Units_Sold, Total_Profit, and more.

loandata.csv: A dataset containing loan application information, including ApplicantIncome, CoapplicantIncome, and LoanAmount.

Key Concepts Explored
The notebook covers the following key concepts of bivariate analysis:

üìä Covariance
The notebook demonstrates how to calculate the covariance between two variables using NumPy's np.cov() function. Covariance measures the direction of the linear relationship between variables.

A positive covariance indicates that the variables tend to move in the same direction.

A negative covariance indicates that they tend to move in opposite directions.

A value near zero suggests a weak or no linear relationship.

For example, the covariance between a and b is calculated as follows:

Python

a = [40,60,30,35,15,36]
b = [15,5,20,21,30,19]
np.cov(a,b)
The resulting covariance matrix shows a negative relationship between a and b.

üìà Correlation
The notebook also shows how to calculate the correlation coefficient, a normalized version of covariance that ranges from -1 to 1. This is done using NumPy's np.corrcoef() and pandas' .corr() method.

A value of 1 means a perfect positive linear relationship.

A value of -1 means a perfect negative linear relationship.

A value of 0 means no linear relationship.

For example, the correlation coefficient between a and b is calculated as follows:

Python

np.corrcoef(a,b)
The result, approximately -0.99, indicates a strong negative correlation between a and b.

The notebook also calculates and visualizes correlations for the loan and sales datasets.

Loan Data: The correlation between ApplicantIncome and LoanAmount is approximately 0.57, suggesting a moderate positive relationship. The correlation between CoapplicantIncome and LoanAmount is a weaker 0.19.

Sales Data: The correlation between Units_Sold and Total_Profit is approximately 0.59, indicating a moderate positive relationship. Similarly, there are strong positive correlations between Total_Revenue and Total_Cost (~0.99), and Total_Revenue and Total_Profit (~0.88).

üìâ Visualizations
The notebook uses seaborn and matplotlib.pyplot to create various plots for visual analysis:

Scatter Plots: Used to visualize the relationship between two numerical variables.

A scatter plot of ApplicantIncome vs. LoanAmount shows a general upward trend, supporting the positive correlation.

A scatter plot of CoapplicantIncome vs. LoanAmount shows a more scattered pattern, consistent with the low correlation.

A scatter plot of Units_Sold vs. Total_Profit also displays a positive, but somewhat dispersed, trend.

Heatmaps: A heatmap is used to visualize the correlation matrix for a set of numerical variables, providing a quick overview of all pairwise relationships.

Box Plots: These are ideal for exploring the relationship between a categorical variable and a numerical variable.

A box plot of LoanAmount by Loan_Status shows the distribution of loan amounts for approved (Y) and not-approved (N) loans.

A box plot of Total_Profit by Item_Type shows how the profit varies across different types of items sold.

Libraries
The following Python libraries are required to run the notebook:

pandas

seaborn

numpy

matplotlib

You can install them using pip:

Bash

pip install pandas seaborn numpy matplotlib
Feel free to explore the notebook, run the code, and apply these techniques to your own datasets!
