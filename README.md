 Daily notebook: August 25, 2025


 📁 Contents
- `uni variate.ipynb` — main notebook for univariate EDA
- `README.md` — you are here

 🎯 Objectives
- Understand the shape of each feature (histograms, KDE, box plots)
- Identify outliers and potential data quality issues
- Summarize key statistics (mean, median, mode, variance, skewness, kurtosis)

 🛠 Requirements
Create a virtual environment and install the dependencies:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install matplotlib numpy pandas seaborn
```

> Detected/assumed libraries from the notebook: `matplotlib, numpy, pandas, seaborn`

    How to Run
1. Clone the repo and move into it.
2. (Optional) Place your dataset (CSV/Parquet) in a `data/` folder.
3. Launch Jupyter and open the notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter lab  # or: jupyter notebook
   ```
4. Run cells from top to bottom.

 🔎 Notebook Outline
Top headings found in the notebook:
- plot.bar
- pie chart
- histogram
- dist plot
- boxplot

Planned/recorded key steps:
- Load dataset
- Inspect columns & types
- Handle missing values
- Plot distributions (hist, box, KDE)
- Summarize findings

 📝 Notes & Tips
- For numeric features, review **histograms** and **box plots** to spot skewness and outliers.
- Consider **log/box-cox transforms** for heavily skewed variables.
- Standardize categorical encodings (consistent labels, case, spelling).

 🖼 Exporting Results
If you save figures, write them to `reports/` with meaningful names like `reports/age_histogram.png`.

 ✅ Next Steps
- Bivariate EDA (pairplots, correlation heatmaps)
- Feature engineering ideas based on univariate findings
- Basic data quality report automation
